# Paper Review of Profiling Platform Storage Using IO500 and Mistral

## Paper Summary

This study investigates how to use IO500 and the Ellexus Mistral tool to
analyze precise performance characteristics in order to tune IO
performance on Astra, an ARM-based Sandia machine with an all flash,
Lustre-based storage array. This article proves, through this case
study, that IO500 serves as a valid storage benchmark, even for all
flash storage. This research also demonstrates the need of employing
fine-grained profiling tools such as Mistral for discovering tuning
demand specifics. Overall, this study highlights the utility of a wide
spectrum benchmark, such as IO500, in conjunction with a fine-grained
performance analysis tool, such as Mistral, for understanding particular
storage system performance and making more informed tuning decisions.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

This article implements IO500 on a new device (AArch64).

### Cons

This article lack of the experiments with other distributed file
systems.

## Brain Storm

Using a comparable system metrics monitor to debug HPC programs is an
excellent method, but it requires significant system and hardware
support.
